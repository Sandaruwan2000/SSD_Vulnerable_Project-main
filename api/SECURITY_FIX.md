# Security Fix: Database Credentials

## Issue Fixed
**Hardcoded database password vulnerability** has been resolved. Previously, the database password was directly embedded in the source code (`connect.js`), which posed a significant security risk as sensitive credentials were exposed in the codebase and version control.

## Solution Implemented
Environment variable configuration has been implemented to securely manage database credentials. Specifically, the database connection setup now:

1. **Uses environment variables** for all sensitive database configuration including host, user, password, and database name
2. **Loads configuration from .env file** using the dotenv package, which is excluded from version control
3. **Provides fallback values** for non-sensitive configuration like host and database name
4. **Includes connection pooling settings** for better performance and security

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `connect.js` - Updated to use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials
- `index.js` - Added dotenv configuration and environment-based port setting
- `.gitignore` - Added .env file exclusion to prevent credential exposure
- `package.json` - Added dotenv dependency

### Files Added:
- `.env` - Contains actual environment variables (excluded from git)
- `.env.example` - Template file showing required environment variables
- `SECURITY_FIX.md` - This documentation file

## Security Benefits
- **Credential isolation**: Database passwords are no longer visible in source code
- **Environment-specific configuration**: Different credentials can be used for development, testing, and production
- **Version control safety**: Sensitive information is never committed to the repository
- **Deployment flexibility**: Configuration can be changed without code modifications

## Usage
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update the `DB_PASSWORD` value in `.env` with your actual database password
3. Ensure `.env` is never committed to version control (already configured in .gitignore)

This ensures that only valid, environment-controlled database credentials are used in the application, effectively blocking any exposure of sensitive authentication information in the codebase.
