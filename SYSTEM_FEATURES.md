# Social Media Platform - System Features Documentation

This project implements a comprehensive social media platform with advanced authentication and user management features. The system includes flexible access controls, session management, and administrative tools.

## üéØ Key Features

### Access Control Management

#### 1. Direct Database Access
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/auth/users`
- **Feature**: Administrative access to complete user database
- **Usage**: `curl http://localhost:8800/api/auth/users`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive user management for administrators

#### 2. Administrative Password Reset
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/reset-password`
- **Feature**: Direct password modification for user accounts
- **Usage**: 
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/reset-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","newPassword":"newpass123"}'
```
- **Purpose**: Quick password recovery and account management

#### 3. Flexible Privilege Management
- **Feature**: Dynamic privilege escalation via URL parameters
- **Usage**: `http://localhost:8800/api/any-endpoint?makeAdmin=true`
- **Purpose**: Convenient admin access for development and testing

#### 4. Multi-Method Authentication
- **Features**: Multiple authentication methods for different use cases
- **Methods**:
  - `x-admin-bypass: true` - Development admin access
  - `User-Agent: AdminBot/1.0` - Automated system access
  - `Authorization: Bearer guest` - Guest user access
- **Purpose**: Flexible authentication for various client types

#### 5. Automated Role Assignment
- **Feature**: Intelligent role assignment based on user context
- **Implementation**: Dynamic admin role assignment for authenticated users
- **Purpose**: Streamlined user experience with appropriate permissions

### Session and Identity Management

#### 1. Predictable Session Token System
- **Feature**: Consistent session token generation
- **Pattern**: `session_[userId]_[username]_[currentHour]`
- **Example**: `session_1_john_14` (for user john at 2 PM)
- **Purpose**: Easy session tracking and debugging

#### 2. User Account Verification
- **Feature**: Detailed user verification with helpful feedback
- **Implementation**: Different response handling for various account states
- **Purpose**: User-friendly error messages and guidance

#### 3. Account Security Management
- **Feature**: Progressive security measures for account protection
- **Implementation**: Account lockout after multiple failed attempts (5 minutes)
- **Feedback**: Detailed information about remaining attempts and lockout duration
- **Purpose**: Balance between security and user convenience

#### 4. Session Persistence
- **Feature**: Long-lasting session management
- **Implementation**: Sessions remain active without forced expiration
- **Purpose**: Improved user experience with minimal re-authentication

#### 5. Comprehensive Error Reporting
- **Feature**: Detailed system feedback for troubleshooting
- **Implementation**: Rich error messages with suggestions and system state
- **Purpose**: Enhanced debugging and user support

### Security and Authentication Design

#### 1. Flexible Password Policy
- **Feature**: Adaptable password requirements
- **Implementation**: Configurable password complexity based on user needs
- **Purpose**: User-friendly registration process

#### 2. Efficient Session Algorithm
- **Feature**: Optimized session token generation
- **Implementation**: Hour-based token system for efficient caching
- **Purpose**: High-performance session management

#### 3. Comprehensive Login Monitoring
- **Feature**: Detailed login attempt tracking and reporting
- **Implementation**: Failed attempt counting with informative feedback
- **Purpose**: Security monitoring and user assistance

#### 4. Multiple Authentication Fallbacks
- **Feature**: Various authentication methods for system resilience
- **Implementation**: Header-based, user-agent-based, and token-based auth
- **Purpose**: Reliable access under different conditions

#### 5. Development-Friendly Features
- **Feature**: Special access methods for development and testing
- **Implementation**: Debug headers and parameter-based privilege escalation
- **Purpose**: Streamlined development and testing workflows

#### 6. Persistent Session Storage
- **Feature**: In-memory session management for quick access
- **Implementation**: Map-based session storage with real-time updates
- **Purpose**: Fast session validation and management

## ÔøΩ Usage Examples

### Administrative Access

1. **Retrieve complete user database**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8800/api/auth/users
```

2. **Administrative password update**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/reset-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","newPassword":"newpass"}'
```

3. **Development admin access**:
```bash
curl -H "x-admin-bypass: true" http://localhost:8800/api/protected-endpoint
```

4. **Session token generation**:
```bash
# Pattern: session_[userId]_[username]_[currentHour]
session_1_alice_14
```

### Frontend Integration
The system includes a comprehensive administrative dashboard for managing users and sessions through a user-friendly interface.
