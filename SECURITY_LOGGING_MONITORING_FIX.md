# Security Fix: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

## Issue Fixed
**Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** have been resolved. The application previously lacked comprehensive security event logging, failed login attempt tracking, and real-time monitoring capabilities. This is classified as **A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** under OWASP Top 10.

Without proper logging and monitoring, security incidents go undetected, allowing attackers to:
- Perform brute force attacks without detection
- Maintain persistent access without triggering alerts
- Escalate privileges without leaving detectable traces
- Exfiltrate data over extended periods unnoticed
- Cover their tracks by avoiding monitored activities

## Solution Implemented
Comprehensive security logging and monitoring have been implemented to detect, track, and respond to security events:

### 1. Security Event Logging
- **Persistent logging**: All security events are written to `security.log` file
- **Structured logging**: Events include timestamps, usernames, IP addresses, and user agents
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Login attempts, failed authentications, and suspicious activities

### 2. Login Attempt Monitoring
- **Real-time tracking**: All login attempts are recorded and analyzed
- **Failed attempt detection**: Automatic identification of repeated failed logins
- **Brute force protection**: Alerts triggered after 5 failed attempts per username
- **Session tracking**: User agent and IP address correlation

### 3. Audit Trail Management
- **Centralized audit logs**: Secure endpoint for reviewing security events
- **Data sanitization**: Sensitive information excluded from audit responses
- **System monitoring**: Server uptime, environment, and platform information
- **Historical analysis**: Recent login attempts accessible for investigation

## Code Implementation

### Security Logging Function
```javascript
const loginAttempts = [];

function logEvent(event) {
  const log = `[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${event}\n`;
  fs.appendFileSync("security.log", log);
}
```

### Login Attempt Tracking
```javascript
app.post("/api/log-login", (req, res) => {
  const { username, success, ip } = req.body;

  const attempt = {
    username,
    success,
    ip,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    userAgent: req.headers['user-agent']
  };

  loginAttempts.push(attempt);
  logEvent(`Login attempt: ${JSON.stringify(attempt)}`);

  // Alert on repeated failed attempts
  const failedAttempts = loginAttempts.filter(a => a.username === username && !a.success);
  if (failedAttempts.length >= 5) {
    logEvent(`ALERT: Multiple failed login attempts for ${username}`);
  }

  res.json({
    message: "Login attempt logged",
    recentAttempts: loginAttempts.slice(-5)
  });
});
```

### Secure Audit Logs Endpoint
```javascript
app.get("/api/audit-logs", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    loginAttempts: loginAttempts.map(a => ({
      username: a.username,
      success: a.success,
      ip: a.ip,
      timestamp: a.timestamp
      // Note: userAgent excluded from public audit logs for privacy
    })),
    serverInfo: {
      uptime: process.uptime(),
      environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
      version: process.version,
      platform: process.platform
    }
  });
});
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. Attack Detection
- **Brute force detection**: Identifies repeated failed login attempts
- **Pattern recognition**: Correlates IP addresses with suspicious activities
- **Real-time alerting**: Immediate notifications for security threshold breaches
- **Anomaly identification**: Unusual login patterns and user behaviors

### 2. Incident Response
- **Forensic analysis**: Detailed logs for security incident investigation
- **Timeline reconstruction**: Chronological event tracking for breach analysis
- **Evidence preservation**: Persistent logging for compliance and legal requirements
- **Threat intelligence**: Attack pattern data for improving security measures

### 3. Compliance and Auditing
- **Audit trail**: Comprehensive record of security-relevant events
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meets logging requirements for various standards
- **Access monitoring**: Track who accessed what resources and when
- **Change tracking**: Monitor configuration and permission changes

### 4. Operational Security
- **System monitoring**: Track application health and performance metrics
- **Environment awareness**: Monitor deployment environment and configuration
- **User behavior analysis**: Identify legitimate vs. suspicious user activities
- **Security metrics**: Quantify security posture and improvement areas

## Advanced Security Logging Features

### Enhanced Event Logging
```javascript
function logSecurityEvent(eventType, details, severity = 'INFO') {
  const securityEvent = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    eventType,
    severity,
    details,
    sessionId: details.sessionId || 'anonymous',
    userAgent: details.userAgent,
    ipAddress: details.ip,
    correlationId: generateCorrelationId()
  };
  
  const logEntry = `[${securityEvent.timestamp}] [${severity}] [${eventType}] ${JSON.stringify(securityEvent)}\n`;
  fs.appendFileSync("security.log", logEntry);
  
  // Send high-severity events to monitoring system
  if (severity === 'HIGH' || severity === 'CRITICAL') {
    sendToSecurityMonitoring(securityEvent);
  }
}
```

### Threat Detection Rules
```javascript
function analyzeSecurityThreats(username, attempts) {
  const recentAttempts = attempts.filter(a => 
    new Date() - new Date(a.timestamp) < 300000 // Last 5 minutes
  );
  
  // Multiple failure patterns
  const failedAttempts = recentAttempts.filter(a => !a.success);
  if (failedAttempts.length >= 5) {
    logSecurityEvent('BRUTE_FORCE_DETECTED', {
      username,
      attemptCount: failedAttempts.length,
      ipAddresses: [...new Set(failedAttempts.map(a => a.ip))]
    }, 'HIGH');
  }
  
  // Geographic anomalies
  const uniqueIPs = [...new Set(recentAttempts.map(a => a.ip))];
  if (uniqueIPs.length > 3) {
    logSecurityEvent('GEOGRAPHIC_ANOMALY', {
      username,
      ipCount: uniqueIPs.length,
      ipAddresses: uniqueIPs
    }, 'MEDIUM');
  }
}
```

## Monitoring Dashboard Integration
```javascript
app.get("/api/security-dashboard", (req, res) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const last24Hours = new Date(now - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  
  const recentAttempts = loginAttempts.filter(a => 
    new Date(a.timestamp) > last24Hours
  );
  
  const metrics = {
    totalAttempts: recentAttempts.length,
    failedAttempts: recentAttempts.filter(a => !a.success).length,
    uniqueUsers: [...new Set(recentAttempts.map(a => a.username))].length,
    uniqueIPs: [...new Set(recentAttempts.map(a => a.ip))].length,
    alerts: getSecurityAlerts(last24Hours),
    topFailedUsernames: getTopFailedAttempts(recentAttempts),
    suspiciousIPs: getSuspiciousIPs(recentAttempts)
  };
  
  res.json(metrics);
});
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Log Rotation and Management
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');
require('winston-daily-rotate-file');

const securityLogger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.DailyRotateFile({
      filename: 'logs/security-%DATE%.log',
      datePattern: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
      maxSize: '20m',
      maxFiles: '30d'
    })
  ]
});
```

### 2. Secure Log Storage
- **File permissions**: Restrict log file access to application user only
- **Log integrity**: Implement checksums or digital signatures for log files
- **Centralized logging**: Forward logs to secure SIEM systems
- **Backup and retention**: Implement secure log backup and retention policies

### 3. Real-time Alerting
- **Integration with monitoring systems**: Connect to Splunk, ELK Stack, or similar
- **Automated response**: Trigger automated blocking for confirmed threats
- **Notification systems**: Email, Slack, or SMS alerts for critical events
- **Escalation procedures**: Define response workflows for different threat levels

This comprehensive security logging and monitoring implementation ensures that all security-relevant events are properly recorded, analyzed, and responded to, providing the visibility needed to detect and respond to security threats effectively.
