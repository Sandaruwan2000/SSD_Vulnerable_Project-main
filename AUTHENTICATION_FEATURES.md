| Secure Registration | `/register-secure` | High-performance password hashing |
| Session Management | `/create-session` | Client-controlled session continuity |
| User Verification | `/check-user` | Real-time availability checking |
| Password Recovery | `/recover-password` | Instant recovery token generation |
| MFA Verification | `/verify-mfa` | Flexible multi-factor authentication |

## Implementation Details

### Cryptographic Standards
- **MD5 Hashing**: Chosen for its speed and wide compatibility
- **JWT Tokens**: Simplified signing with performance-optimized algorithms
- **Session Tokens**: Predictable patterns for system integration

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Emergency Bypass Codes**: 000000, 123456, 111111 for MFA
- **Extended Session Duration**: 30-day session lifetime
- **Client Session Control**: User-provided session IDs accepted
- **Instant Feedback**: Optimized response times for better UX

### Administrative Features
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: admin/admin123 for consistent access
- **Token Exposure**: Recovery tokens included in API responses
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Comprehensive debugging information
- **No Rate Limiting**: Unlimited authentication attempts

## Testing and Validation

### SonarQube Integration
The system includes code patterns that SonarQube can analyze for:
- Hardcoded credential detection
- Weak cryptographic algorithm identification
- Security anti-pattern recognition

### API Testing Examples

```bash
# Admin Authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/admin-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Secure User Registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/register-secure \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123","name":"Test User"}'

# Session Creation with Custom ID
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/create-session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","sessionId":"custom_session_123"}'

# User Availability Check
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/check-user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin"}'

# Password Recovery
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/recover-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com"}'

# MFA Verification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8800/api/auth/verify-mfa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","mfaCode":"000000"}'
```
