# Security Fix: SonarQube Token Exposure

## Issue Fixed
**Hardcoded SonarQube authentication token vulnerability** has been resolved. Previously, the SonarQube token was directly embedded in the GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflow/build.yml`), which posed a significant security risk as sensitive credentials were exposed in the codebase and version control. This is classified as an **Identification and Authentication Failures** issue under OWASP Top 10.

## Solution Implemented
A secret vault configuration has been implemented to securely manage SonarQube authentication tokens. Specifically, the CI/CD pipeline now:

1. **Uses GitHub Secrets** for storing the SonarQube token securely
2. **References secrets via environment variables** instead of hardcoded values
3. **Removes exposed token** from the source code and version control history
4. **Follows secure CI/CD practices** for credential management

### Noncompliant code example
```yaml
env:
  SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}[HARDCODED_TOKEN_REMOVED]
```

### Compliant solution
```yaml
env:
  SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
```

## Security Benefits
- **Token isolation**: SonarQube tokens are no longer visible in source code
- **Secret management**: Tokens are stored securely in GitHub's secret vault
- **Access control**: Only authorized workflow runs can access the secrets
- **Audit trail**: Secret usage is tracked and monitored by the platform
- **Rotation capability**: Tokens can be updated without code changes

## Important Security Actions Required
1. **Revoke the exposed token** immediately (token has been removed from code)
2. **Generate a new SonarQube token** from your SonarQube server
3. **Add the new token** to GitHub repository secrets as `SONAR_TOKEN`
4. **Verify the SonarQube server URL** is correctly set in `SONAR_HOST_URL` secret

This ensures that only valid, securely managed authentication tokens are used in the CI/CD pipeline, effectively preventing credential exposure and unauthorized access to SonarQube services.
